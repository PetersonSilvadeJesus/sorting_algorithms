# sorting Algorithms
The project was built in PHP and Javascript.
It aims to: Develop a program with graphical interface to represent the operation of search/sort algorithms. The idea is to create a tool to help in understanding/learning the operation of search algorithms (operation, complexity, animation).
The algorithms are implemented and compared to each other for their complexity and execution time. The user can interact with each algorithm by manually entering the data list to be sorted, entering through a text file, or asking the program to randomly create the list to be sorted (whose size will be informed by the user).
